**PCL Registration in ROS environment.
Point Cloud Registration using PCL library and CUDA environment: CPU and GPU implementations 
The ICP algorithm Naive 
The ICP algorithm with OcTree structure 
CUDA implementation was taken and modified and integrated with ROS environment from https://github.com/botforge/CUDA-ScanMatcher-ICP for OcTree and 
https://github.com/michaelwillett/Iterative-Closest-Point.git for KdTree
